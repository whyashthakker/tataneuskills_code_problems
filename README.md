## Setting up Virtual Environment and Installing Requirements

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd tataneuskills_code_problems
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     python3 -m venv myenv
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Your prompt should change to indicate the virtual environment is active.

5. Install requirements from requirements.txt:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. You're now ready to work on your project with all the required packages installed.

7. When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```

Remember to activate your virtual environment each time you work on your project.
